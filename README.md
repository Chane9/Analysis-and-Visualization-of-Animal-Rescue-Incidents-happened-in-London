# Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Animal-Rescue-Incidents-happened-in-London

This project is to explore the animal rescue incidents happened in London hosted by London Fire Brigade, based on dataset [Animal Rescue Incidents Attended by LFB](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb) on London Datastore.

This dataset contains animal rescue information such as Date of the incidence, Type of the incident, Rescued animal condition, Cost incurred, Location information and so on since January 2009. In this report, I will look into the questions:
1. What is the pattern of the animal rescue acts yearly and monthly
2. Which kind of animal being rescued the most?
3. What is the most frequent act of rescue?
4. Where do animals usually encounter problem? (Geographical Visualization - Both token needed and not methods)
5. How could we predict the incurred cost for the future?

For more details, please check the [Analysis and Visualization of Animal Rescue Incidents happened in London.ipynb](https://github.com/Chane9/Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Animal-Rescue-Incidents-happened-in-London/blob/main/Analysis%20and%20Visualization%20of%20Animal%20Rescue%20Incidents%20happened%20in%20London.ipynb) file. I sincerely hope more and more people would be willing to give a helping hand when animals are in need.
